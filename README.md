# Hi there! I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹

## My Coding Journey ðŸš€
I've learned a lot of different programming languages. I started with C in my first year at Uni. Having your whole program not compile because of one semi-colon used to make me want to pull my hair out sometimes not going to lie. But, I started to appreciate how much power and control it gives you in typesetting and memory management. Then I moved on to Python. I created a few games with it using the Pygame library. It was pretty cool. I then dabbled in a few other languages like HTML, CSS Haskell, etc. I really loved how Haskell could let you do powerful operations with just a few lines of code. Towards my final two years of university, I fell in love with two programming languages: Java and PHP.

Coding with Java using OOP just made so much sense to me! I think the best way to solve problems is by breaking them down into smaller ones. And OOP helps you conceptualize your program and separate them into objects. 

Many of my coursemates didn't really enjoy PHP. But, I just loved how it helped me incorporate HTML directly into PHP code haha.

After I graduated from my university CompSci Degree, I took two online courses: The Odin Project and The MongoDB Developer course.

That's where I learned and created some cool projects using the MERN stack.

## What I'm Looking For ðŸ‘€
I'm really looking to dive in and start working as a developer.

I want to be a founder of a Startup that solves a really important problem in the future (In my 40's probably)

For now, I really want to join a startup with a small company headcount. This way, I can learn more and make a real impact/ be a part of something.
